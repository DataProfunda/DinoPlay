# DinoPlay
Play chrome Dino with your smile! Used lib OpenCv.

#How it works?
OpenCv library has pretrained Haar cascade models. At first we are detecting face. If face is detected, we are looking for a smile.
When we are smiling Dino is happy so he jumps! Now we can play Dino without touching keyboard!
